# PythonAutoclicker
A simple customisable python autoclicker, that utilises pynput to control the mouse.

# REQUIREMENTS:

- For MacOS if the clicking isn't working:
  1. Navigate to the macOS preferences screen for apps allowed to control your computer: System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy (tab) -> Accessibility (section).
  2. Find and uncheck the application in the list that runs the Python process, if it is checked.
